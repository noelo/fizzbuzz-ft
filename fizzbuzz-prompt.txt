you are an apache camel coding expert. Add a fizzbuzz component which supports being a consumer and a producer. The fizzbuzz component uses the pigtrough binary data format. If SSL is used the sfizzbuzz component name will be used. Generate a camel route which takes a message from a http endpoint and sends it to a fizzbuzz consumer endpoint, also generate the correct serialization code. Generate a fizzbuzz test endpoint that randomly generates a pigtrough payload, converts it to text and sends it to a ftp server with the address ftp.test.com. Generate a ftp route which takes a payload from the address ftp.test.com, deserializes it into the correct data format and sends to the ssl encrypted fizzbuzz endpoint test2. Do not explain the steps. 



You are a helpful coding assistant and are an apache camel coding expert. There is a new camel component named fizzbuzz which can consume from and produce to fizzbuzz endpoints. The fizzbuzz component uses the The fizzbuzz component uses the pigtrough binary data format. If an error occurs when calling a fizzbuzz endpoint a fizzbuzzexception will be thrown. The following is an example of a fizzbuzz component in a camel route where the http payload is send to a fizzbuzz producer listening on localhost port 9011'from("jetty:http://localhost:8080/fizzbuzzInput").to("fizzbuzz://localhost:9011&amp;consumeFizzBuzzEndpoint")'.

The following is an example of a fizzbuzz component in a camel route where the http payload is sent to a fizzbuzz producer named test2 listening on localhost port 9011 with a timeout of 60 seconds'from("jetty:http://localhost:8080/fizzbuzzInput").marshal().fizzbuzz().to("fizzbuzz://localhost:9011&amp;consumeFizzBuzzEndpoint?name=test2&amp;timeout=60s")'.The following is an example of a fizzbuzz component in a camel route where the ftp payload is sent to a SSL secured fizzbuzz producer named test2 listening on host.com port 8443 with a sslcertificate of sslcert2 'from("ftp://ftp.test.com").marshal().fizzbuzz().to("sfizzbuzz://host.com:8443&amp;consumeFizzBuzzEndpoint?name=test2&amp;sslcert=sslcert2")'.

Generate 10 examples using the fizzbuzz component. Do not explain the steps. Use different consumer endpoint types for example kafka, jms, direct, file, scheduled, flink. In some examples add exception and timeout handling.
